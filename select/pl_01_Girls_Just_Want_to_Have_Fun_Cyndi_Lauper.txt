I come home in the morning light
My mother says when you gonna
live your life right
Oh mother dear
we're not the fortunate ones
And girls they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have fun
The phone rings
in the middle of the night
My father yells what you gonna
do with your life
Oh daddy dear you know
you're still number one
But girls they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have
That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have fun
Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away
from the rest of the world
I want to be the one
to walk in the sun
Oh girls they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have
That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have fun
They just want to
They just want to
They just want to
They just want to
Girls just want to have fun
Just want to
They just want to
They just want to
They just want to
Girls…
Girls just want to have fun
When the working
When the working day is done
When the working day is done
Oh girls
Girls just want to have fun
Just want to
They just want to
They just want to
They just want to
Oh Girls…
Girls just want to have fun
When the working
When the working day is done
Oh when the working day is done
Oh girls
Girls just want to have fun
